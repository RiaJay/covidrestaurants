	<p>   The whiff you get the moment you enter a Fresh location assures you that the meal you're about to enjoy will be nothing short of amazing. With nine locations spanning Toronto, Fresh prepares wholesome plant-based food in a masterful way. If you're looking for an exciting twist on tacos, their crispy cauliflower tacos are incredible. Another handheld favourite is their buffalo wrap, featuring crispy chick'n, buffalo sauce, vegan ranch, and fresh veggies. If you're looking for an even more nourishing meal, look no further than their salads and bowls. Among the salads, their supergreen caesar with tahini dressing is a personal favourite of mine. As for the bowls, the buddha and goddess bowls deliver modern takes on Asian flavours, while the tiger bowl always leaves me satisfied. Pro tip: when you visit, always order a side of onion rings, and never skimp on the sauce (trust us). </p>
